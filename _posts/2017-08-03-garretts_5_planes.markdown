Most people who work in UX know who Jesse James Garrett is. He wrote what is esentially the bible of user experience called "The Elements of User Experience". Jesse James Garrett defined the model that UX designers follow. He called this model the 5 planes of user experience. The five planes are as follows:

1. Strategy - User needs/Business goals
2. Scope - Functional specs/Content requirements
3. Structure - Information architecture 
4. Skeleton - Navigation/Layout/Information design
5. Surface - Visual design

The idea is that all five of these things must be included and considered when creating something that will be useful, useable, and valuable. I've found these "planes" to be extremely useful in creating projects. I like to keep a notebook where I'm able to go through and write down each part of the planes and then sketch out what I want the visual design to be. Maybe pen and paper isn't your style, but find a way that fits for you! You cannot be in UX without addressing Garrett's 5 planes before every project. Well, maybe you can be in UX without it, but your product just won't be as good as it could be.
