Two weekends ago I signed up for a technical interview prep course in the Seattle area. I graduated Flatiron in January and have been reviewing JavaScript and other areas of the curriculum that I felt I needed more practice in. I also had started to look into interview prep topics and began studying algorithms and data structures. For the most part I felt okay about it, but I decided that I wanted to really pursue it further and take a course. I'm so glad that I did. A huge part of technical interview prep is training your brain to think a certain way. When I first started coding I ended up looking at websites a completely different way than I had before. My brain started seeing functions and css styling everytime I loaded up a new webpage. Technical interviewing is somewhat similar. You need to train your brain to start looking at and approaching interview questions a certain way. After just two weekends in the class I can already start to feel a difference in the way I approach technical interview questions, however I still have a lot to learn and a ways to go. 

On the first day of class my teacher compared technical interview questions to driving. The first time you drive to a new address you have zero idea where you're going. You have out your map app and give yourself ample time to get somewhere. The second, third, fourth, and maybe more times you still need the map up, but you're starting to recognize landmarks and you know the general area where you're trying to reach. Then you start not needing the map. It's training your brain to do something over and over and approach things in a certain way. I really identified with her analogy and it gave me confidence that I will learn this stuff - it just takes practice.

The imposter syndrome can feel very real sometimes, but keep at it. Keep practicing!
