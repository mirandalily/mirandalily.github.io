User experience is what inspired me to get involved in web development. When I come across a website or an app that has a truly beautiful and useful UI/UX, it really satisfies something in me. I decided to take a course on Udemy about User Experience just to reinforce, and maybe learn some new, concepts.

There are 4 phases in UX design.

1. Definition - Why are we doing what we're doing? Why are we building what we're building? This is like a company's mission statement, and it's really important. 

2. Information Architecture - What content are is needed in our website/app? This includes cateforizing information and deciding what needs to be placed where and why. 

3. Design - How should our site look? What is an appropriate User Interface for our project?

4. Development - This is the building part, which I think is probably one of the easier parts of UX. It's putting all of the pieces together, but the really important part is deciding which pieces are going to be there in the first place. 

Over the next few weeks I will be building a B2B Website, a Wordpress Blog, and an eCommerce site and blog about the experience. Designing for each one will be very different and take many different concepts of UX into account. I'm looking forward to doing it - especially the Wordpress blog :)
