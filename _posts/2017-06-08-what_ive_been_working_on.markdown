Today is a short post as I've been balancing job search and family health issues these past few weeks. Since graduating Flatiron my main priority as far as projects goes is finishing up the bank of projects I have started. This mostly involves styling - which is my favorite part of coding :). I want to have tangible products that I can show potential employers. Ontop of doing that I have been working on a portfolio! I think it's important to not only have completed projects to show potential employers or customers, but also have one easy place where they can access it all. I've actually put together a portfolio that I'm happy with (for the moment - I'm sure I'll tweak it in the future). I am planning to launch it in the next week or so and will provide a link to it here. I also would like to connect this blog to it as well. 

I want to be honest here and say that it's been a difficult past few weeks in regards to family. I have a family member who's terminally ill and it's been tough. However, coding has provided me a sort of sanctuary and structure in my life. It's something that I can do to escape from things because it requires all my brain power. I'm really thankful for it right now and will keep chugging along in the job search process. Next week I'll be looking "under the hood" at objects and functions so come back for that! See you then.
