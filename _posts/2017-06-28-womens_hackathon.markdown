I've had my eye on hackathons for a while now - but they've always been somewhat intimidating to me. I'm not quite sure what they're like, and anything new is kind of scary! But I've found an event that I'm hoping to be able to attend this year. It's called Women's Startup Hackathon. It's a 3 day event that goes from July 21-23, 2017. It is put on by extraSlice and takes place in Bellevue, Washington which is just across the lake from Seattle! 

They have the itinerary clearly laid out on the event website. The first 30 participants bring in 60 second pitches for their ideas for projects, and then the top 10 are chosen. 10 groups are then formed to work on each of the projects. There is a networking dinner and two breakfasts, as well as speakers and a final presentation for each of the projects. 

I think it's an approachable hackathon for my first one. I like that this one is focused on women in tech as I'd really like to make some more in-person connections with women who code! I thought I would make a blog post on it this week in case any of you ladies who are reading this live in the Seattle area and might like to join! If you buy early bird tickets, the price is 20$, and the later regular price is 35$. I'm excited to try something new - and maybe a little nervous. But these are the kinds of things that help you grow as a person - and as a programmer!
