It's always a little dangerous to talk politics on the Internet. It seems that this is especially so given the current political climate. Political opinions are like...bellybuttons. Everybody's got one. But in the early days of 2017, I couldn't help looking back on the year 2016 and the election and notice what an incredibly huge part programmers have come to play in the past couple elections - this one especially. It's fascinating to see the role that the Internet and web applications have come to play in elections and day to day politics. It's an ever-evolving beast, and it's evolution comes out of the minds of programmers. 

Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit were all huge participants in this year's election. Platforms that programmers like you and me created are fostering an environment of sharing and accountability within the political atmosphere. For example, on Monday night Congress tried to quietly introduce a bill that would effectively gut the independent ethics committee. Much to their dismay, I'm sure, the move spread like wildfire across social media. It went viral, and the next morning Congress reversed their decision. With players like Twitter and Facebook it seems that there are budding, and effective, ways of holding politicians accountable. This is good.

As a new generation - one of avid Internet users - comes of voting age, these platforms are going to matter more and more. The younger generation consumes news and data in a very different way from it's predecessors, and that power lies in the hands of programmers. It will be incredibly interesting to see what applications creative minds develop in the coming years and how those will influence future politics and elections. It will be even more interesting to be on the other side of the Internet so to speak, and possibly get the opportunity to work on something that has revolutionized, or will revolutionize, the political landscape like Twitter, Facebook, or something entirely new. People are coming to depend more and more on programmers whether they realize it or not. Arguably, it has, and will continue to become, one of the most important jobs in the world. People trust you to create programs that will keep their information safe, and provide them with platforms to seek out information. I'm coming to understand what a great responsibility programmers currently have in the world, and what responsibilities may come to light in the future.
