So CSS is something that can be super frustrating for some people. It can get out of hand pretty quickly if you don't keep things organized. One of the things I struggle the most at with CSS is positioning elements. Flexbox is something that really changed my experience with CSS. I'm currently working my way through a website called Flexbox Froggy which teaches you the basics of flexbox in a really helpful and image oriented way. Here is the website! www.flexboxfroggy.com 

Apologies for the short post today. My grandmother passed away this week and I am taking some much needed time to myself to spend with family.
