An important (and sometimes confusing) topic in JavaScript is inheritance. This week I learned about Classical and Prototypal Inheritence. First let's start off with a basic definition of inheritance: when one object gets access to the properties and methods of another object. Classical inheritance is probably the best known and most popular inheritence as it is present in C# and Java. It's based off of classes instead of prototypes. Classes create subclass relationships by inheriting from other classes. Prototypal inheritance is a prototype that is working on an object instance. There are pros and cons to both but after doing research online I've found that many JavaScript developers find prototypal to be better as it is simpler, it's dynamic, and it leads to less redundant code. And I have, in fact, ended up preferring to use prototypal inheritance!
