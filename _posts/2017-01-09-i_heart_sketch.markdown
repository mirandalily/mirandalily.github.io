One of the main reasons I got into web development is because I have an undying passion for fantastic web design. I've spent countless hours on websites like Awwwards.com and Webbyawards.com. Finding a new beautiful clean design is like opening up that one present you've always wanted on Christmas. But no matter what I do I've struggled to create something that lives up to what I expect it to. It's always missing that little something. I know that it takes years sometimes to get to where you want to be as a designer. To know what works and what doesn't. But I ended up finding something that drastically has improved my designs. I purchased the Sketch app a few months back. It's a prototyping tool that allows you to plan out your designs in advance and gives you exact dimensions of design placements. It's absolutely changed my design process. I didn't realize what a mistake I was making designing as I went along. It's reminded me just how important the "pen and paper" aspect of web development is. I used to rush into projects without planning and just try to keep all my ideas in my head. That's not a process that has worked out very well for me. I'm a visual person so it's incredibly important and helpful to sit down and visualize what I want my projects to be and what pieces are a part of the bigger puzzle. Same with design. You save so much time figuring out what works and doesn't work in a much easier setting like Sketch. 

Sketch is $99, however I found out about a student discount that they offer students for 50% off. They just require proof that you're a student so I ended up emailing them a copy of a Flatiron receipt with my name on it and they gave me a code for 50% off! There are a lot of great prototyping options, and if design is your thing I highly recommend finding one that fits for you.
