In celebration of a great interview that I had today I wanted to post some resources for anyone else out there that may be looking for a tech job. I've been using these resources and they've all offered something of use so far. 

1. LinkedIn
This one's obvious, but the jobs section on LinkedIn is great for finding job postings in your area. It's also good for finding companies in your area that you may be interested in. They may not have any job postings at the moment, however they might in the future...or you could always reach out and ask about any opportunities or if they're willing to keep your resume on file. 

It's also great for networking and pinpointing people in companies that you may be interested in talking to based on their position. 

2. The Muse
I haven't seen this one talked a lot about but it is a fantastic site. Not only do they have a great blog with plenty of great articles about interviewing and finding jobs, but they also have a jobs board. Unforunately I think it's pretty much only jobs posted in major cities...so if you're in a small town you may be out of luck here. But they offer the ability to narrow down your searches by keywords and the level of job you're looking for (ie. entry level, mid level...etc). 

3. Angel.co
Angel.co is a jobs board specifically for startups. Like The Muse they are mostly posting jobs in major US cities (or abroad), but keep an eye out in case there may be some startups in your town! 

4. Indeed
I find that Indeed can be a little bit overwhelming at times. The interface feels a little cluttered to me and there are *so* many job postings to sift through. I do like that they offer a filtering system like The Muse where you can search specifically for, say, entry level positions. 

5. Front End Developer Interview Questions
https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions
This is a fantastic resource that has made it's way around the internet. I'm personally making my way through it now. Of course it's mostly only applicable to front end positions which is what I am interested in applying for. So if you're front end, definitely take a look!

I hope everyone has a great rest of their week!
