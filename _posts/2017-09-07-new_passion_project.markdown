In light of the recent hurricane that hit the Houston area, and the imminent hurricane Irma that is about to hit Florida I started thinking about technology and how it could help out in situations like these. I had a lot of ideas, but I wanted to do something that I was really passionate about. I've always had immense love and compassion for animals since I was a child. Seeing some of the images of people's pets that were left behind in these hurricanes is absolutely heartbreaking for me. So I decided that those feelings are what will drive my next app build. I want to make an app where people can list dogs that they've found, or find the closest local shelter where they can drop off a pet instead of leaving them behind in a house to drown. Technology makes things easier for people, and when things are easier people tend to do them. I'm really excited about this app and am writing up which migrations I'll need to write and then come up with the design. My family and I had to unfortunately put down my dog of 14 years the other day, and so I want to create this app in his memory. <3
