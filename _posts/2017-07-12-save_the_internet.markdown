It's Net Neutrality Day! What is net neutrality exactly? Well, it means that you as the consumer pay an Internet Service Provider (ISP) to get access to the internet, and you get to choose which sites you visit and which sites you consider the "best". However this is in jeopardy, because ISP's could potentially gain the power to give you a curated version of the internet. And that curated version will be sites provided to you who's owners have bid the highest to your ISP (paid prioritization). ISP's will also be able to block sites. Essentially, we as consumers need to demand that we have access to the entire internet. This is like someone saying to you "You're only going to patronize Starbucks now, because we think it's the best (aka they paid us the highest for us to say this and enforce it)". It absolutely undermines competition on the internet. The internet should be open because that's what makes it beautiful. The internet is a global community with it's own market - and we need to keep that market open. We cannot have monopolies. So what can you do? You can click on this site: https://netneutrality.internetassociation.org/action/, watch the video to learn more, and sign a petition telling the FCC that they need to not rollback the rules. We need free and open internet. As someone who's future job will depend on a free and open internet this is extremely important to me, but it should also be important to any user of the internet. Keep the internet free and open!
