I wanted to post this week about a nonprofit that I came across after reading an article on Medium. The article was about being a woman in tech, and specifically about harassment (in light of the Google manifesto released). The nonprofit is an organization that "works to empower underrepresented groups in technology by dismantling negative stereotypes surrounding technical careers. we aim to dispel the misconception that computer science is not a career for women and minorities by rebranding what it means to be a technologist." 

The organization released an award winning short documentary. The organization also has an awesome blog that highlights women in tech, and a lot of other awesome stuff. Their most recent post is introducing a podcast about 3 black women in tech called "The Three Unicorns". The blog can be found [here](http://sheplusplusblog.tumblr.com/).

If you are a female in tech you can submit your stories, good or bad, [here](https://medium.com/@sh_reya/it-starts-early-my-experience-as-a-female-tech-student-dc0b83c0f73b). At the end of the article there is a link to an anonymous Google form that you can fill out. 

It's *clearly* important work that this organization is doing (*ahem* Google *ahem*) as there still are so many stereotypes that we need to break through. I'd really like to see companies make a more public and concerted effort to include women and minorities in their engineering departments.
