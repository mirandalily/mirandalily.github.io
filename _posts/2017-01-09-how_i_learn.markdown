Many times throughout the program I've anxiously compared myself to other learners. Am I learning the material fast enough? Am I grasping the core concepts that are necessary to find a job? More than a few times I've felt dumb. During assessments when I'm put on the spot to solve something I've stumbled. The thing is though, I know the answers. I know where to look to teach myself how to solve the problem. Through high school and college I found that I've had to see a concept a couple times before it's cemented in my brain. And that's okay. That's not dumb. It's okay to have a few (or many) moments where you don't feel like you're the sharpest tool in the shed, but you can't let yourself drown in those feelings. Take the time to learn how you learn - not how you think you should learn or how others learn. I think there's a lot of pressure that we put on ourselves to get things the first time, and when you're in a program where time is money...that pressure is that much more present. I know that it takes me a couple tries to see a new concept and then be able to implement it without Googling. So going forward into the job searching process I'm going to take the time to go back over the parts of the Learn program that I struggled with and take a look at things a second, or even third, time.
