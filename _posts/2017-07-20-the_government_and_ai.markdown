Aritficial Intelligence is something that I've always been interested in. It's something that seems futuristic and kind of far off, but it's not as far off as we think. About a week ago a video was released about Youtube of Google's DeepMind AI teaching itself to "walk". Here's a link to it (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gn4nRCC9TwQ). The AI had no guidance in any of this, and each motion that the stick figures are making the AI taught itself. 

Over the weekend Elon Musk met with Governors in Washington DC to discuss AI technology and it's possible dangers. He claims that it actually poses an "existential threat" to the human race. One of the worries is of course AI robots "taking our jobs". But Elon's fears go further than that. Elon has access to the most cutting edge AI technology...and to be frank - it scares the crap out of him. The purpose of him meeting with Governors was to talk about regulation. He says that once AI is out there, and we react to the problem's it creates with regulation it will be too late. 

It's hard for me to imagine what Elon is clearly imagining, but I do think regulation is important to get on right away. I think we've already seen this in what is the internet. The internet blew up far faster than I think anyone expected and really laws are just starting to catch up with it now. We didn't regulate the internet until after issues started to arise. I think it's an important lesson in not underestimating the power of things and getting ahead of it in government regulations. However on the other side of things, I think if we regulate, we need to convince other countries to regulate as well for everyone's safety.
