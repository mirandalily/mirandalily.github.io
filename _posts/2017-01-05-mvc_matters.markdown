Model-View-Controller.

I remember when I first began coding I had no idea what MVC was. I had just started dabbling in JavaScript and was creating a very disorganized application in my text editor of choice - Atom. Anytime I ran into an error, I did a lot of scrolling to get where I knew the problem was. My file got large very quickly, and large files tend to lack organization. I can't imagine another developer trying to navigate that project and figure out what was what. 

In enters a developers best friend - MVC. Model-View-Controller is a pattern used by developers in order to keep projects organized by separation of internal representations of information. Having completed all of the Learn projects in the Flatiron program now (and using MVC in them), I feel as if there are 3 main reasons that one should use MVC. The first is that you benefit from organization. It's pretty straightforward that it's just easier to navigate your project when it's organized and packaged neatly. The second is that it makes your code reusable to you. You can reuse bits of code wherever you need them without having to load a bunch of other unecessary bits and pieces. It's efficient and quick and saves you the trouble of rewriting the same code. The third reason is that it makes your code much more intuitive and easy to deal with when another developer takes a crack at it. Coding has become a very collaborative process. Projects just aren't usually done by some guy living in his moms basement. The more people you add in to a project, the more possibility there is for chaos. So it's incredibly important to stay organized, not just for yourself, but for others collaborating with you - or really anyone looking at your code (i.e. Hiring Managers). 

So use MVC. It's your best friend and while you may be creating a lot of different files, in the end it's far easier to separate out your concerns and deal with small bits of code when the inevitable error pops up in your console.
