This weekend I spent time wireframing out what I want my animal welfare app to look like. I'm a huge fan of a more minimalist clean look. So I came up with the login and signup screens! Over the next few days I will work on the actual body of the app. I have a few different wireframes mocked up on how it could look but I haven't picked which one I want to use for the UI yet. As soon as I do I will take the wireframe into Sketch and mock it up like I've done with the login and signup screens.
